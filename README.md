# SQL Exercise: Understanding and Reversing Actions

Welcome to our SQL exercise focused on understanding and reversing database actions. This exercise will help you grasp the impact of various SQL operations and learn how to reverse these operations, where possible. It is designed to enhance your understanding of SQL commands within a PostgreSQL environment and to highlight the importance of careful database management.

## Objective

Your task is to write SQL commands to accomplish a series of operations on a database and its tables and then reverse those operations, where applicable. This exercise aims to teach you about the reversibility of SQL actions and to think critically about the permanence of database operations.

## Instructions

1. **Fork and Clone**: Fork this repository and clone it to your local machine to start working on the exercise.

2. **Read the Exercise File**: Open the provided SQL exercise file that contains a series of tasks, each with hints to guide you in writing the correct SQL commands. Pay close attention to the hints, as they are designed to help you figure out the necessary commands without directly giving you the answers.

3. **Write Your SQL Commands**: In the `submission.sql` file, write your SQL commands for each task according to the hints provided. Ensure you also write the commands needed to reverse each action, following the guidelines in the exercise file.

4. **Verify Your Commands**: Before finalizing your submission, verify each of your commands in a PostgreSQL database environment to ensure they work as expected. This verification step is crucial to ensure your SQL commands produce the correct outcomes.

5. **Include Observations**: At the end of the `submission.sql` file, include comments with your observations about what operations were easy to reverse, which were not, and the implications of irreversible actions in database management.

6. **Commit and Push**: Once you have completed the exercise and verified your SQL commands, commit your changes to the `submission.sql` file and push them to your forked repository.

7. **Submit a Pull Request**: Submit a pull request to the original repository for review. This pull request will serve as your exercise submission.

## Expectations for the Submission.sql File

- **Completeness**: Your `submission.sql` file should include all SQL commands for accomplishing the tasks and their reversals, as per the exercise instructions.
- **Accuracy**: Each SQL command should accurately reflect the task it is meant to accomplish and successfully reverse the action, where applicable.
- **Formatting**: Ensure your SQL commands are well-formatted and easy to read. Use comments to separate tasks and to include any observations or reflections.
- **Reflections**: Include your reflections on the exercise, focusing on the reversibility of SQL operations, at the end of the `submission.sql` file.

## Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated based on completeness, accuracy, adherence to instructions, and your reflections on the exercise's learning objectives. Demonstrating a thorough understanding of how to perform and reverse SQL operations will be key to a successful submission.

Good luck, and we look forward to seeing your SQL commands and reading your insights into database operations!
